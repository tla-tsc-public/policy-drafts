# TSC Policy Drafts

Working drafts developed by the Technical Steering Committee for 
interoperable learning data infrastructure.

## Current Drafts

### 1. Open Source Policy
Guidance on preferred and acceptable open source licenses, 
stewardship and sustainability expectations, transparency 
requirements, and commitments to equity and inclusivity in 
open source development.

### 2. xAPI LRS Test Suite Advisory Plan
Recommendations on what the xAPI LRS Test Suite needs to be 
and what it needs to do, including automated conformance testing, 
certification policy, and governance of the test suite as a 
shared community resource.

## How Drafts Work

- All drafts are working documents subject to TSC review and revision
- Changes require a pull request and approval from at least two organizers
- Discussion happens in GitHub Issues and Discussions — not in private channels
- Version history is preserved permanently through git commit history

## Contributing

All TSC members may:
- Open Issues to raise questions or concerns
- Submit Pull Requests to propose specific language changes
- Participate in Discussions for broader policy conversations

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Heritage Acknowledgment
