# Contributing to TSC Policy Drafts

Thank you for contributing to the Technical Steering Committee's 
policy development work. This document explains how to participate.

## Who Can Contribute

- **TSC Members**: Full participation — issues, discussions, 
  pull requests, and reviews
- **TSC Organizers**: Same as members, plus responsibility for 
  merging approved changes
- **Public**: Anyone may view all content and open issues to 
  provide feedback. Pull requests from non-TSC members will be 
  reviewed but require TSC discussion before merging.

## How to Contribute

### Raising a Question or Concern
Open an **Issue** describing your question, concern, or suggestion. 
Use a clear title and reference the specific policy section if 
applicable (e.g., "Open Source Policy Section 3.2 — Acceptable 
Licenses").

### Proposing a Specific Change
1. Fork the repository or create a branch
2. Make your proposed edits to the relevant markdown file
3. Submit a **Pull Request** with:
   - A clear title describing the change
   - A rationale explaining why the change is needed
   - Reference to any related Issue
4. Two organizers must review and approve before merging

### Participating in Discussion
Use the **Discussions** tab for broader conversations that don't 
propose specific text changes — for example, debating approach, 
raising new topics, or sharing relevant precedents from other 
organizations.

## Contribution Principles

### Transparency
- All substantive discussion about policy content happens in 
  public (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions) — not in private 
  email, DMs, or side conversations
- If a decision is reached outside of GitHub (e.g., on a call), 
  it must be documented here with rationale before it is considered 
  final

### Attribution
- Git commit history serves as the permanent record of who 
  contributed what and when
- Contributors are credited through their commits — no separate 
  contributor list is maintained
- Do not commit on behalf of others without their explicit consent

### Intellectual Property
- By submitting a pull request, you confirm that you have the 
  right to contribute the content and that you agree to license 
  it under CC BY 4.0, consistent with this repository's license
- You retain ownership of your contributions — the CC BY 4.0 
  license grants the community the right to use, adapt, and 
  redistribute with attribution
- Do not submit content that is subject to "use with permission" 
  restrictions, proprietary copyright, or any terms incompatible 
  with CC BY 4.0

### Conflicts of Interest
- If you are proposing a change that could affect a product or 
  organization you have a financial relationship with, disclose 
  that relationship in your pull request description
- This is not a barrier to contributing — it is a transparency 
  requirement

## What Belongs Here vs. Elsewhere

| Content | Where It Goes |
|---------|---------------|
| Policy draft text and edits | This repo (`policy-drafts`) |
| Meeting agendas and minutes | `meeting-notes` repo |
| Operating procedures and COI disclosures | `governance` repo |
| General discussion not tied to a specific draft | Discussions tab |

## Review Process

1. Pull request submitted with rationale
2. Organizers review for clarity, consistency, and alignment 
   with TSC direction
3. TSC members may comment and request changes
4. Two organizer approvals required to merge
5. Merged changes become the current working draft
6. Major policy changes (licensing, heritage acknowledgment, 
   educational content licensing) require documented TSC 
   supermajority per the amendment process

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to engage respectfully and 
professionally. Disagreement on policy substance is welcome 
and expected. Personal attacks, dismissiveness, and bad faith 
argumentation are not.

## Questions

Open an Issue or start a Discussion. There are no gatekeepers 
to asking questions.
